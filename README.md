# music-kmeans-recommender-tkinter-csharp-spotify
🎧 Music Recommender System using K-Means | C# + Python + Spotify API

This project implements a complete music recommendation pipeline based on K-Means clustering. Audio features like danceability, energy, loudness, valence, and tempo are extracted from a CSV file and processed using a custom K-Means implementation in C#.

The clustered data is exported and visualized in a user-friendly Python Tkinter GUI, where users can:

Upload their own dataset

Filter songs by mood/cluster

Sort by title or artist

Open songs directly in Spotify using the integrated Spotify API.

🔧 Technologies Used:
💻 C# (.NET) — custom implementation of K-Means algorithm

🐍 Python — GUI built with Tkinter, data handled via Pandas

🌐 Spotify API — integration for dynamic music search/playback

🎯 Features:
Upload custom CSV music dataset

Cluster tracks into 3 mood-based groups

Interactive filtering and sorting of recommended tracks

One-click access to listen via Spotify
